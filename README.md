# flutter\_device\_apps\_android

Android implementation of the [flutter\_device\_apps](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_device_apps) federated plugin.

This package provides the Android-specific code for `flutter_device_apps`. It should **not** be used directly in apps. Instead, depend on the umbrella package:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_device_apps: latest_version
```

The umbrella package will include this implementation transitively.
